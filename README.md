# Schibsted

Implement a Web Application using C# language.

This application will have 3 different private pages and a login form. 

In order to access any of these private pages, the user must have a session started through the login form and must have the right role to be able to access the page. 

The application will also have a REST API endpoint exposing the “User” resource. 

Creating, deleting and modifying users and their permissions will be done through this API.
